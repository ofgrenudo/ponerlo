Currently I need to create, Get-CategoryID, New-CategoryID, Get-ManufactureID, New-ManufactureID.

The category and manufcature must be pre existing to submit a new model. Hopefully, we wont use the New-ManufactureID feature too often, but just incase. We will want to create both New-Manufacture* and New-Category* features.
