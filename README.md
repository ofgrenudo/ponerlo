## Contributing

As you contribute to this project, it is expected that you handle a bug or an issue as a feature branch. That branch should contain the one issue, or major failure that you are experienceing. And then be pushed to the main branch.

If you are working on a Roadmap issue, your branch may deviate more drastically than a minor bug, which is okay. But still should only contain code that is consistent with the issue you are trying to solve.
